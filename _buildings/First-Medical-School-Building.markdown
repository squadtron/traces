Melbourne Medical Schoolâ€™s first building was situated on the north-eastern part of the campus across the lake from the rest of the University (now represented by the Quadrangle.). The building was completed in May 1864, designed by Messrs Reed and Barnes who also designed Ormond College, the Baldwin Spencer Building and the original Wilson Hall as well as the State Library and the Melbourne Town Hall.  After 1885, when anatomy and pathology moved alongside, it became the physiology department. The second story was added in stages in 1900, 1905, and in 1913 the portico was demolished.   The whole building was demolished in 1970.
