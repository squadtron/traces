title: 'Leather roll-up case with dental instruments'
---

This is an early example of dental instruments and would have been similar to the cases carried by itinerant dentists in the early settlement of Victoria. Early Victoria saw very little regulation of dentistry and was often practiced by people with no medical training. In this era there was little conception of oral care and hygiene and most dentistry consisted of tooth pulling and extraction. The tools in this case would have been used primarily to pull teeth.
