James George Beany (1828-1891) was a senior surgeon at the Melbourne Hospital. He was better known as “Champagne Jimmy’ due to his penchant for that particular drop, as evidenced by the bottle at his feet. Dr Beaney became a controversial and scandalous public figure due to his involvement with the death of a young barmaid, Mary Lewis. Beany was suspected of causing her death through an illegal abortion and was tried twice for an illegal operation. Beany was found not guilty but the attention the trials garnered made him a notorious public figure.
