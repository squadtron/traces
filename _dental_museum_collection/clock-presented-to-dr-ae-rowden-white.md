Clock presented to prominent Melbourne doctor AE Rowden White. Dr Rowden White trained at the Melbourne Medical School and was presented this clock by ‘two grateful patients.’ The clock officially came into the Medical History Museum’s collection in 2011 when the collection of the Australian Medical Association (Vicotira) was donated to the museum after being on loan since 1994.
